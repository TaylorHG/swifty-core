# Forgive Me
Forgive me for not having done the following yet:

### TODO List for 0.1.0 Beta version:
- Clean up files that should be ignored by npm and git
- Move Layer States to Layer Instances
- Remove all these `process.cwd()` calls. Instead pass it around where needed. This allows the CLI to run projects in any directories and makes everything less brittle.
- Better Configuration, possibly through `.js` file rather than `.json` file.
- Allow for configuration of logger.
- CLI to generate project
